### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently looking for a job.

I'm excited about low-level systems, algorithmic problems, and collaborating
with curious and kind people. I care deeply about learning, teaching, and
having fun.

Right now I'm having the most fun programming in Rust. Most recently, I was at
Google working on Fuchsia, a new general-purpose operating system written in
Rust and C++.

If you're hiring -- especially for an in-person Rust job -- please reach out!
